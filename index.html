    <h2>What is Dropshipping?</h2>
    <p class="dropshipping">
        With dropshipping you need no
        <ul>
            <li>Inventory</li>
            <li>Coding/design skills</li>
            <li>Experience</li>
        </ul>
        You NEVER handle or ship anything yourself. Items ship directly to your customer from the supplier. You don't even buy anything until someone buys it
        from you first, at a profit! You then pocket the profit and scale.
    </p>

    <h2 class="faq">FAQ</h2>
    <h3>What is the startup and monthly cost?</h3>
    <p>
        The startup cost is broken down into two different portions. Intially you will need $20,000 to sign up for the service, and then an additional $1,000-$2,000 for ad spend
        and to cover orders when they come in so we are able to begin shipping immediately. Once you sign up, there is an ongoing 30% profit share that is paid to me and my team
        for keeping the store running.
    </p>

    <h3>What are the average profit margins?</h3>
    <p>
        Average profit margins are between 15-25%. We typically do not see margins lower than 15%, and we do have some clients seeing more than 25% sometimes hitting 50% or more.
    </p>

    <h3>How long does it take to make my initial investment back?</h3>
    <p>
        You can expect it to take rougly six months, just to be safe. In most cases though it is much shorter, coming in around three months.
    </p>

    <h3>How much does the average client profit per month?</h3>
    <p>
        On average, our clients are making between $10,000-$35,000 in profit per month. Keep in mind that all stores vary, so profits may be more or less than the average.
    </p>

    <h3>How long does the setup process take?</h3>
    <p>
        We can usually get the store completely set up in two weeks. Someitmes it may take longer, depending on various factors.
    </p>

    <h3>Do you offer a contract? What about a refund?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes. I pride myself on being one of the few services in the industry that offers both a contract and a refund.
    </p>

    <h3>How many clients are you currently managing?</h3>
    <p>
        We are currently managing over XXX clients and their stores. Some of our clients even have multiple stores. In 2021, we plan to hit 300 total clients.
    </p>

    <h3>Why do some stores do better than others?</h3>
    <p>
        Multiple factors play a part in this. Every stores is selling different products, so naturally sales and profits vary. Some clients also have more money to put into ad spend,
        which at times can help to bring in more sales since they are able to reach more customers.
